# 39 Weeks
## It's not long to go now....
### Iâ€™m now in the last few weeks of pregnancy and feel incredibly lucky about how smooth it has all been so far. That may all change in the next few days/weeks but at least I have had a good stretch up until this point. Pete and I are trying to eat well and keep as active as possible. I feel fairly puffed out after a short walk but a short walk is better than nothing! We have been doing lots of little beach walks near home and are very much looking forward to our new arrival this spring.
