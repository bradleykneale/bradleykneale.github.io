## BRADLEY'S DEVELOPMENT

This month Bradley turned nine months!

I know I’m biased but I have to say that Bradley is turning into a smart little boy.

Bradley’s speech is now really coming along. He points and says ‘Gat’ to most things. He often says a dog/duck sounding word whilst pointing to a dog/duck. He says Grr when pointing to the Gruffalo. He’s also started sayings tricker sounding word ‘Ticker ticker’ (20.07). He talks the most when he’s tired so the last half hour of his day is usually a very chatty time for him. 

Bradley’s comprehension is also rapidly improving. He seems to now understand Dada, Mama, Gruffalo, lion, dog, clap, wave, tree, eye, point and up. He responds appropriately to those words (I.e by pointing or clapping when asked). He’s especially very good at pointing to Dada and trees when asked (from 01.07) and is getting good at waving and pointing to eyes too. Bradley did his first proper wave on cue on the bus when I asked him to on the 10th July.

Bradley continues to be on the move this month. He confidently walks around the sofas (holding on) and up the stairs. He frequently stands for 5 seconds and the record is currently 20 seconds (27.07).

With regards to eating, Bradley is crazy about bread/toast, cheese, yogurt and spaghetti bolognese. He will eat most foods but will point, clap and squeal if fed any of the above items. It’s very sweet! 

Bradley initiated his first game of peekaboo on the 6th July. He put the scarf in front of his face to hide a number of times whilst we were out on the bus. It was great fun. 
Passing is another fun game that Bradley like to play. Bradley can now pass and retrieve objects and enjoys doing this with Pete. 

Bradley now wears pull up nappy pants. How very grown up! 

On a final note, Bradley is starting to have some very cute predictable behaviour. Here’s a little list for you:
- He gets very excited when Pete comes home. 
- He always starts clapping/bopping when I sing ‘Grand Old Duke of York’ 
- He bops to ‘I just Haven’t Met You Yet’ by Michael Bubble. 
- He crawls to the bottom on the stairs ready to climb but waits and turns around first to check you’re coming to watch. 
- He now knows the bath is upstairs so he’ll climb all the way up just to have a look
- If you start singing ABC, he’ll point to the ABC wall
- If you say ‘Where is Bradley?’, he freezes and smiles thinking you can’t see him. He might even be kind enough to shout ‘Gat’ to Help you
- If he sees a dog, he will point and stare for as long as possible

## ACTIVITIES THIS MONTH
OUT and ABOUT

We continue to visit beaches and parks pretty much every day. Its a great place for crawling practice and exploring. Bradley loves to have a swing too. It’s also super quiet and relaxing for me as Australians don’t seem interested in visiting the beach in the winter. We often have the beach to ourselves.  

We also continue to meet up with my mothers group and other local mums on a regular basis and we popped into the city twice to see Pete.

Bradley had his first swim in an indoor swimming pool on 1st July and he loved it. It got a little chilly after 15 mins as just splashing around so we will find a little wetsuit for him next time so we can stay in a bit longer. 


AT HOME

At home, Bradley’s favourite activity is story time. He squeals with excitement when a book is taken out of the book box or off the shelf. It’s adorable. He loves all Spot books, I Am Hungry (a big pop out lion at the end), ABC zoo, Where is the Green Sheep, The Gruffalo, Where is Baby, Dear Zoo and Whose Bottom just to name a few. At the end of July, he’s started being too scared to lift the flaps in Where’s Spot because he knows there are lions and bears underneath. Aw! He’s very good at lifting all the flaps and he’s also quite good at tearing them out. Grrrr. 

Aside from reading, we love to dance and play music. We have been having a Michael Bubble morning dance every morning this past month and he loves it. As soon as the music starts, he rocks his body and flaps his arms. 

Now that Bradley is getting a little older, we have been able to start doing some fun indoor sensory activities. Lately we have done finger painting and have played with bubbles, oats, bubble wrap and banana play dough. I’ve nearly finished creating a cool play website to log all the activities we’re doing and to help keep me inspired to try new activities. I’ll send out the link soon. Watch this space :)

We had a few celebrations this month. We had a lovely meal out with George and Angela to celebrate George’s 75th birthday. We also tried to get on a little train but the queues were long and Bradley was about to nod off. Next time! 

We also went to little Spencer’s 1st Birthday party. It was Bradley’s first kids party in Australia.
