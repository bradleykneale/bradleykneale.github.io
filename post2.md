# WEEK 1
## It's now been one whole week since Bradley entered this world and WOW...what a week it's been! Here are some key highlights from the week:
## MY LABOUR
Due to having gestational diabetes during pregnancy, Manly hospital were keen for me for me to be induced no later than one week past Bradley's due date (28th September) to help ensure he would be born safely. So with no signs of Bradley arriving any time soon, we packed our bags and headed to the hospital on Monday 2nd October to start the induction process. After two induction sessions at 1pm and 7pm, my labour began the following morning at 3am and progressed fairly quickly. It was all going routinely until the last hour when they realised that he'd turned into an awkward position and was getting a little stressed so it was deemed best to go into surgery to help get him out a little quicker. With the help and support of Pete and the awesome team at Manly, our little Bradley was born at 12.53pm on Tuesday 3rd October. The midwifes have since said it was super speedy for an induced birth as they were expecting him to arrive around midnight rather than midday. I don't think I could have lasted that long! Birth was a colourful experience and I feel in no rush to do it again any time soon!!!
## BRADLEYâ€™S STATS
His full name is Bradley David Bobby Kneale. His weight is 3.61 kg (7.9 pounds) and height is 53 cm (21 inches). 
## OUR TIME IN HOSPITAL
As Bradley was a little stressed in that last hour of labour, they decided to keep Bradley and me in for three nights. All tests came back fine and Pete and I quite enjoyed all the support and help we got from the midwifes in those first few days. I think it would have been a lot harder for us if we had to go home straight away. We learnt how to feed, wind and swaddle! Pete is now a swaddle pro! We also had Pete's parents visit us on Day 3 which was lovely. They got to see their first grandson and I got to have a rest! Everyone was happy.
## GOING HOME
So we were finally given the all clear on day 4 and headed home at midday. It felt super surreal leaving the hospital with our new addition. We felt like we were playing parents with someone else's child. We are now slowly settling into our new little life with Bradley and have throughly enjoyed cuddling and playing with him this week. We managed our first little outing today (Day 7) to the park at the back of our house and have already introduced him to country music. He now has better control of his hands, is sleeping and feeding fairly well and loves loves LOVES to be held and cuddled.
